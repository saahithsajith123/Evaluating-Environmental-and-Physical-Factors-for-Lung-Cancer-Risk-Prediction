Lung cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, emphasizing
the critical need for effective risk assessment and early detection strategies. This study
investigates the potential of leveraging environmental and physical factors to predict
individual lung cancer risk using advanced machine learning models.
Two distinct datasets were analysed - one containing environmental factors and another
focusing on physical attributes. The results suggest that the physical subset may be a
stronger indicator of lung cancer risk, as evidenced by the higher average probability
of "High Risk" classification and improved performance of the machine learning
models.
Gradient Boosting demonstrated the highest accuracy of 0.895 for the environmental
dataset. Notably, all three modelling techniques - Random Forest, Logistic Regression,
and Support Vector Machines - achieved remarkably high accuracies of 1.0, 0.835, and
0.985, respectively, when applied to the physical dataset.
These findings highlight the promising potential of machine learning-based approaches
for lung cancer risk assessment, particularly when incorporating physical factors.
However, the study also underscores the need for further research with more
comprehensive datasets and the exploration of more sophisticated modelling
techniques. Such advancements could lead to enhanced accuracy and generalizability
of the risk prediction models, ultimately contributing to improved early detection and
personalized management strategies for this deadly disease.
